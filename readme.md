# Typing Speed Calculator

## Overview

This project is a user-friendly tool designed to measure typing speed accurately. It provides an interface for users to input a custom paragraph, which can be saved. The main window displays the saved text, featuring a dynamic cursor that reflects the user's position within the text. Once the user completes typing the saved text it shows the typing speed.

## Speed Calculation Logic

The typing speed is calculated considering 5 characters as a single word. Mismatches are highlighted in red until corrected. A background timer starts on typing initiation and stops when the user completes the paragraph. The Words Per Minute (WPM) is calculated as (total characters/5) * 60 / (time taken in seconds).

## Instructions

1. Click the button to input a custom paragraph.
2. Save your text using the "save" button.
3. View saved text in the main window with a dynamic cursor.
4. Typing speed is calculated automatically based on the provided logic.
