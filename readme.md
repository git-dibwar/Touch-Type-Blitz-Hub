# Typing Speed Calculator

## Overview

This project features a user interface allowing users to input a custom paragraph, with a save function. The main window displays the saved text and includes a dynamic cursor to track the user's position.

## Speed Calculation Logic

The typing speed is calculated considering 5 characters as a single word. Mismatches are highlighted in red until corrected. A background timer starts on typing initiation and stops when the user completes the paragraph. The Words Per Minute (WPM) is calculated as (total characters/5) * 60 / (time taken in seconds).

## Instructions

1. Click the button to input a custom paragraph.
2. Save your text using the "save" button.
3. View saved text in the main window with a dynamic cursor.
4. Typing speed is calculated automatically based on the provided logic.
